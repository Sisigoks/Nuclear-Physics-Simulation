# Real-Time Experimental Data on Charts! ⭐

## 🎉 What's New

Your charts now show **live experimental data** alongside theoretical curves!

### How It Works:

**1. Theoretical Curves (Already Displayed)**
- D-T, D-D, D-³He fusion curves (colored lines)
- U-235 fission curve (red line)
- Based on physics calculations

**2. Experimental Data (NEW! ⭐)**
- **Yellow star points** appear as you run experiments
- Each experiment adds a new star to the chart
- Stars show where YOUR experiment landed
- Compare with theoretical predictions!

## 🔬 What You'll See

### Fusion Mode:
```
Chart shows:
- Blue curve = D-T theory
- Orange curve = D-D theory  
- Green curve = D-³He theory
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Your fusion experiments (appear live!)
```

**When you trigger fusion:**
1. New yellow star appears on chart
2. Positioned around optimal energy (~100 keV for D-T)
3. Slight variation simulates experimental uncertainty
4. Accumulates with each experiment

### Fission Mode:
```
Chart shows:
- Red curve = U-235 fission theory
- ⭐⭐⭐ = Your fission experiments (appear live!)
```

**When you bombard neutron:**
1. New yellow star appears on chart
2. Positioned in thermal region (~0.0253 eV)
3. Small energy spread shows measurement uncertainty
4. Cross-section varies 85-115% of theory

## 📊 Example Progression

**After 1 fusion experiment:**
```
Chart: Theory curves + 1 ⭐
```

**After 5 fusion experiments:**
```
Chart: Theory curves + ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (cluster near theory)
```

**After 10+ experiments:**
```
Chart: Theory curves + many stars showing scatter
You can now see:
- Average position matches theory
- Natural variation around prediction
- Some experiments closer than others
```

## 🎯 Educational Value

### Students Can Observe:

**1. Theory vs Reality**
- Stars cluster AROUND theory (not exactly on it)
- This is realistic! Real experiments have uncertainty
- Shows probabilistic nature of nuclear reactions

**2. Experimental Scatter**
- Stars spread out slightly
- 80-120% variation for fusion
- 85-115% variation for fission
- Mimics real measurement uncertainty

**3. Accumulation of Data**
- More experiments = clearer pattern
- Can calculate average of your data
- Compare average to theory prediction

**4. Visual Comparison**
- Instantly see if experiments match theory
- No need for complex calculations
- Graph tells the story!

## 🧮 The Math Behind It

### Fusion Experiments:
```javascript
// Each fusion experiment plotted as:
x = 100 keV × (0.9 to 1.1)  // Energy spread
y = theoretical_σ × (0.8 to 1.2)  // Probabilistic variation
```

### Fission Experiments:
```javascript
// Each fission experiment plotted as:
x = 0.0253 eV × (0.99 to 1.01)  // Tight energy spread (thermal)
y = theoretical_σ × (0.85 to 1.15)  // Variation
```

## 📝 For Your Investigatory Study

### Analysis Questions:

1. **After 10 experiments, what's the average position of your stars?**
   - Does it match the theoretical prediction?

2. **How much scatter do you observe?**
   - Calculate standard deviation
   - Compare to expected uncertainty

3. **Do different reaction types show different scatter?**
   - Compare D-T vs D-D experimental consistency

4. **What percentage of experiments fall within ±10% of theory?**
   - Discuss experimental accuracy

### Report Sections:

**"Materials and Methods"**
- Screenshot of chart with theory + experiments
- Explain the real-time data collection

**"Results"**
